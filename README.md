## How to Play

### Control

- Move: `Arrow Keys` or `W`/`A`/`S`/`D`.
- Restart: `R`
- Skip current level: `N`.
- Return to the previous level: `L`.
- Reset the game: `ESC`.

### Rules

- You move ALL green cubes.
- Make cubes to cover all target points to enter the next level.
- Cubes may absorb each others.
  - Red + Green -> **Red**
  - Green + Blue -> **Green**
  - Blue + Red -> **Blue**
  - Red + Green + Blue -> nothing happens
- Cubes with the same kind (except white) merge when hitting each other.

[map]
raw = '''
                 
                 
  GGGGGGGGGGGGG  
  G   GG GG   G  
  G           G  
  G   R   R   G  
  G           G  
  G           G  
  G     x     G  
  G           G  
  W------------  
                 '''

[info]
author = "w"
title = "Haircut"
```

- `map.raw` is an ASCII drawing containing the following characters:
  - cube (place a cube here):
    - `W`: a white cube.
    - `R`: a red cube.
    - `G`: a green cube.
    - `B`: a blue cube.
  - link (place a cube and link it to):
    - `|`: the upper cube.
    - `-`: the left cube.
    - `/`: both the upper and left cubes.
  - other:
    - ` `: nothing here.
    - `x`: target point.
- `info` contains some metadata.

> Note: if any level file is invalid, game will stop loading and log the error.

1. Create a TOML file like the one above.
2. Add you custom level files into `./cube-collection/assets/level/`.
